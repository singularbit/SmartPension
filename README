The objective of this work is to create a fully contained environment comprised of:
- A MultiAZ VPC with Public and Private Subnets
- A LoadBalancer with Autoscaling, supported by a CDN and DNS
- A MultiAZ database running on Private Subnets
- A MultiAZ application running on Private Subnets

The Software is to be run on Docker with separate instances for the Webserver and the Application

The present scripts are incomplete due to lack of time will not launch the demo application successfully.
However, from what I have done so far I believe it should be enough to demonstrate my concept.

The CloudFormation stack and the docker-compose file live at:
git clone https://github.com/singularbit/SmartPension.git
